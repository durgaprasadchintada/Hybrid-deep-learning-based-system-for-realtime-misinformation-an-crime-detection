# Hybrid-deep-learning-based-system-for-realtime-misinformation-and-crime-detection


Built a realtime project on Misinformation and Crime detection on social networks using BERT/LSTM and CNN/YOLO.
Manages complexity and done many test cases on the model. Balancing both categories and developed a resposive UI.
